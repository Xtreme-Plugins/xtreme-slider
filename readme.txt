Beautiful image slider with 4 layout modes, infinite loop, and shortcode embedding. No jQuery on frontend, no WooCommerce required.

== Description ==

XtremeSlider is a free, lightweight WordPress slider plugin that lets you create stunning image sliders with four distinct layout modes and embed them anywhere using a simple shortcode.

Built for performance — the frontend uses pure vanilla JavaScript with zero external dependencies.

= Four Layout Modes =

**Default** — Editorial full-bleed slider with peek effect. Center slides are fully visible while adjacent slides peek from the edges. Features infinite seamless looping, vertical title text overlay, and caption/description sections below center slides.

**Cool** — Card-based slider with customizable gradient background. Rounded-corner slides with hover lift effects and pagination dots.

**3D** — Dramatic CSS perspective slider with depth transforms. Center slide is prominent while adjacent slides rotate and scale back in 3D space with glassmorphism-styled arrows. Per-slider background color.

**Options** — Static grid of clickable option cards (image + title + caption). Clicking a card reveals its own HTML content in a detail panel below — useful for product variants, plan comparisons, or "pick one, see details" interfaces. Each card's HTML is editable with inline Code / Preview tabs. Per-slider background color.

= Key Features =

* **Infinite Loop** — Default layout uses clone-based seamless cycling that never ends
* **Up to 10 Slides** — Add up to 10 images per slider with drag-to-reorder
* **4 Content Fields Per Slide** — Title (vertical overlay), Caption (heading below), Description (paragraph below), Link URL
* **Relative & Absolute Links** — Link to `/roofing` or `https://example.com`
* **Image Ratios** — Choose 16:10 (landscape), 1:1 (square), or Fixed Height (pixel height, width scales to natural proportions) per slider. Premium adds Default (original) ratio
* **Autoplay** — Configurable speed (2-10 seconds), pauses on hover
* **Fullscreen Mode** — 100vw edge-to-edge display
* **Touch & Swipe** — Full mobile touch support
* **Responsive** — 4 breakpoints (desktop, tablet, mobile, small mobile)
* **Hover Effects** — Image zoom on hover, caption underline color change
* **Link Hover Color** — Configurable per slider via color picker
* **Gradient Background** — Two-color gradient picker for Cool layout
* **Background Color** — Solid color picker for 3D and Options layouts
* **Display Toggles** — Square corners and black arrows toggles per slider
* **Shortcode Overrides** — Override layout, visible count, autoplay, fullscreen per instance
* **Conditional Loading** — CSS/JS only load on pages containing a slider

= No Dependencies =

Fully standalone. No WooCommerce, Elementor, or any other plugin required.

= Elementor & Gutenberg Compatible =

== Changelog ==

= 1.4.3 - 9th May 2026 =
* Fixed Cool layout fixed-height sliders losing navigation arrows when more than one slider was on the page — slide widths are derived from natural image dimensions, but lazy-loaded images had not finished loading at init time, so the max-page calculation read width 0 and hid the arrows. Layout and arrow visibility now re-run as each slide image loads, plus once on `window.load`

= 1.4.2 - 9th May 2026 =
* Fixed Cool layout with fixed-height image ratio cropping wider images by forcing all slides to a uniform slot width — slides now keep each image's natural width derived from its aspect ratio at the configured fixed height
* Cool layout navigation in fixed-height mode now scrolls by per-slide width instead of a uniform page step

= 1.4.1 - 20th April 2026 =
* Added `Options` layout — clickable static cards that reveal per-slide HTML content in a detail panel below
