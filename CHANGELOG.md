# Changelog

All notable changes to XtremeSlider are documented here.

## [1.4.3] - 2026-05-09

### Fixed
- Cool layout fixed-height sliders lost their navigation arrows when more than one slider was on the page. In fixed-height mode each slide's width is derived from the natural width of its (lazy-loaded) image, but `getMaxPage` was measuring `slide.offsetWidth` at `DOMContentLoaded` — before images had loaded — so the total measured width was 0, max-page was 0, and `updateArrowVisibility()` hid both arrows. The first slider on the page typically used non-fixed ratio (computed slot widths) and so was unaffected, which made the bug look like a "second slider" issue. Layout + arrow visibility now re-run as each slide image fires `load`, plus once on `window.load` as a fallback.
- Extracted the resize/load recalculation into a single `recalcLayout()` method so `update*` and `updateArrowVisibility()` can't drift out of sync.

## [1.4.2] - 2026-05-09

### Fixed
- Cool layout with `Fixed Height` image ratio was cropping wider images because all slides were forced to a uniform slot width (`viewport / visible`). Slides now keep each image's natural width derived from its aspect ratio at the configured fixed height, so doors of different widths (e.g. 204×450 vs 294×450) display in their proper proportions instead of being clipped by `object-fit: cover`
- Cool layout navigation in fixed-height mode now advances by the per-slide width (cumulative offset) instead of a uniform page step, and `getMaxPage` accounts for variable slide widths so the last slides remain reachable

## [1.3.4] - 2026-04-11

### Added
- `Black arrows` display option to switch slider navigation buttons to solid black circles with white icons

### Fixed
- Existing installs now auto-add the new `black_arrows` slider column during upgrade so the option saves cleanly without manual database work

## [1.3.3] - 2026-04-11

### Changed
- Free mode is now limited to 2 total sliders, while premium keeps unlimited slider creation
- Slider list header now disables `Add New Slider` once the free-tier slider cap is reached and shows current usage in the admin

### Fixed
- New slider creation is now blocked at both the admin UI layer and the save handler, preventing cached forms or direct links from bypassing the free-tier slider cap

## [1.3.2] - 2026-04-11

### Added
- Premium license activation with site-bound validation, unlocking up to 50 slides per slider and up to 15 visible slides
- Premium-only `Default (Original ratio)` image ratio option to preserve each image's natural aspect ratio
- `Load Titles` editor action to fill slide titles from image filenames before saving
- `Square corners` display option to switch slide images from rounded to sharp corners

### Changed
- Save feedback on the editor now uses a compact inline status pill beside the save button
- Image ratio selectors in the editor and settings now adapt to the active license tier while preserving legacy premium values during edits

### Fixed
- Slider creation could fail when older installs were missing newer columns such as `title_shadow`; storage repair now self-heals schema drift before save
- Slider saves are now transactional, preventing orphaned or partially-saved slide rows when a database write fails
- Upgrade routines now add the new `square_corners` column on existing installs automatically

## [1.3.1] - 2026-04-05

### Fixed
- Gradient color fields now display the actual saved value after reload — removed `?: default` fallback from the input `value=` attribute that was masking the real DB value with the default color even when a different color (including white) was saved
- Arrows no longer shown when slide count equals visible count (nothing to scroll)

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-05

### Added
- Fixed Height image ratio option — user sets a pixel height; width scales automatically to preserve natural image proportions
- DB migration: `fixed_height` column added to `wp_xs_sliders` with live ALTER TABLE support for existing installs

### Changed
- Sidebar sections compacted (reduced padding/gaps) so Save button is visible without scrolling
- Fixed Height input now appears inline next to the Image Ratio select instead of occupying a separate row
- Color pickers now initialized per-field with correct `defaultColor` so Clear button restores the field's own default (red for link hover, pink/purple for gradient) instead of resetting to white

### Fixed
- Colors saving as `#ffffff` when Clear was clicked — Iris wp-color-picker was defaulting to white with no `defaultColor` set
- Hex color sanitizer now correctly accepts 3-digit shorthand (`#fff`) and expands to 6-digit
- Color field defaults (`link_hover_color`, `gradient_start`, `gradient_end`) applied after sanitization instead of before, preventing wrong fallback on invalid input

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-25
